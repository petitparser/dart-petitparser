PetitParser
===========

Grammars for programming languages are traditionally specified statically. They are hard to compose and reuse due to ambiguities that inevitably arise. PetitParser combines ideas from scannerless parsing, parser combinators, parsing expression grammars and packrat parsers to model grammars and parsers as objects that can be reconfigured dynamically.

PetitParser was originally implemented in [Smalltalk](http://scg.unibe.ch/research/helvetia/petitparser). Later on, as a mean to learn these languages, I reimplemented PetitParser in [Java](https://github.com/renggli/PetitParserJava) and [Dart](https://github.com/renggli/PetitParserDart). The implementations are very similar in their API and the supported features. If possible I tried to adopt common practices of the target language.

Continuous build results are available from [Jenkins](http://jenkins.lukas-renggli.ch/job/PetitParserDart/).
